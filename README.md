# Developer Salary Prediction

Predict Your Salary! ðŸ˜Ž

> 2021-1 POSTCH IMEN472 Statistical Data Mining Team Project

This is a collection of code that our team have written and experimented with.

## Abstract

A salary is one of impoartant thing that we are interested in. [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) conducts [anuual survery for developers](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey), so we suggest a project to construct the developer salary model using that survery data. We refine the survey into the dataset by handling outliers and NaN values. Weâ€™ve experimented six models of parameteric and non-paremteric. We report what features are important to predict salary, and compare the results. We release our dataset and code in GitHub.

## Models

- Linear Regression
  - Subset Selection
    - Forward Selection
    - Backward Selection
  - Ridge Regression
  - Lasso Regression
- GAM; Generalized Additive Model
- MARS; Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines
- XGBoost

## Result

|Model|R-square|RMSE|
|:------:|:---:|:---:|
|LS-forward|0.651|25,003.50|
|LS-backward|0.651|24,999.85|
|Ridge|0.650|25,043.36|
|Lasso|0.651|24,994.60|
|GAM|0.628|26,100.10|
|MARS|0.680|24,140.75|
|XGBoost|0.714|22,925.37|
